                        <p><span class="dropcap">K</span>yle Magee is no stranger to challenges that require creative solutions. While obtaining his BS in Graphic Design at The Art Institute of California - San Diego he was teaching himself how to build information systems and how to craft interfaces for the users of those systems. His extensive knowledge has come to encompass not only composition and aesthetic alone but web applications and the servers they run on.</p>
                        <p>Since graduating Kyle has never stopped learning. His interests have turned more specifically toward the technology that powers the web. In the past he’s been involved with creating automated solutions for graphic design & print production. Currently he develops custom websites & web based applications using a myriad of cutting edge platforms, frameworks, and languages for both ecommerce and blogging. Despite this there is no substitute for a firm grasp of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. Making use of best practices for optimized markup he’s designed web based software which dynamically creates product imagery for large scale retail websites, event attendance management systems, and executive recruitment tools for obtaining visitor submitted data. In many cases these applications required 3rd party API integration where data is captured, processed, then transmitted.</p>
                        <p>He has a passion for design, data, art, and code. But most importantly their potential for being melded together in beautiful representations that tell a story, and deliver memorable user experiences that serve a purpose. These days if he’s not riding his bike, drawing in his sketchbook, or even glued to his wacom tablet working on a digital illustration, he’s writing code for the web where technology is the medium. </p>
